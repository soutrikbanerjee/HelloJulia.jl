# Developer notes


## Environment management

All tutorials use a common Project.toml/Manifest.toml pair, located at
the root level.

**IMPORTANT** Always ensure the version of Julia used to generate this pair matches what
is declared in `/FIRST_STEPS.md`. This needs to match `JULIA_VERSION` defined in
src/HelloJulia.jl.


## Notebook types

There are three kinds of notebooks generated from a basic Literate.jl
compatible script maintained by the developer, called `notebook.jl`,
in each of the sub-folders of `/notebooks`:

- `notebook.ipynb`: A pre-executed Juptyer notebook
- `notebook.unexectuted.pynb`: An unexecuted Juptyer notebook 
- `notebook.pluto.ipynb` : A Pluto notebook

Note that you must not recycle variable names or the Pluto notebook
generated won't run properly. 


## Generating the notebooks

To generate notebooks do `include("path/to/HelloJulia/src/generate_all.jl")`. For some tutorials, a notebook
may not be generated, because of some known issue. A warning will be issued and you'll
need to generate the relevant notebook by hand. 

For example, to generate an executed python notebook for `notebooks/01_first_steps/`, copy
`notebook.unexecuted.ipynb` to `notebook.ipynb`; execute the latter file and save.

To generate notebooks for just one tutorial, `include` the file called
`generate.jl` within the notebook's folder.

## Pre-compilation

To add to what is pre-compiled in the system image generated by
`setup()`, modify the file `/precompile/warmup.jl`.


## Pluto table of contents

This can be updated by editing `src/notebooks.jl` (you shouldn't need
to touch `/notebooks/pluto_index.jl`).
