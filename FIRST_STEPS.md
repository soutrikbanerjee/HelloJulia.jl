# Installing Julia

Follow these **four** steps to install Julia on your computer:

1. If you are a Windows user, install [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) and make
   sure you know how to open a new terminal process (window), into which you can type
   commands. If the link doesn't work, try a different browser.

2. Follow [these official installation instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
  
3. Open a terminal window and type `julia`, and press `RETURN` or `ENTER`. This
  launches a command-line interface for interacting with julia called the
  [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop).

4. *Testing.* At the `julia> ` prompt, type `println("Hello world!")` and press `RETURN`
  or `ENTER`. The words "Hello world!" should be repeated back to you. You can quit the
  Julia session by typing `exit()` or entering `CONTROL+D`.
